# DM's Toolkit

Just a simple toolkit for DMs to share their screen and control units with.    

You can move units around

Update their status

Spawn new units in

Hide their names and Delete them

You can set new sprites by going to DM's Toolkit > Resources, create a folder there with your sprites, then add the folder name to the UIManager's Load Sprites script.
You may need to adjust the Pixels Per Unit value of your sprites so that they fit.  

It is currently rather limited, but may grow more in the future.  
This was made in Unity 2019.1.13f1, but I can't see why it would break too much in other versions.  
This currently lacks Build support and is just a project in-editor, but still usable.  

The map drawing is not mine, I found it on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/AVFT2DVN6ZcXeIOxDBcLe6fQVD0NV068S-kt4i0G_MA-CWXGVG6LsgY/)
